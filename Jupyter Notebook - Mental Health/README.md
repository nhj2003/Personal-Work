Was interested in investigating mental health issues. Got the specific dataset off kaggle.com, went through multiple different datasets until I found one that
I felt I could do proper EDA and prediction on. This one was one of the datasets that fit the criteria I had so I am using it. I am mostly using this specific
project to get better with pytorch and its systems, considering I haven't really been using it in the past but more using sklearn systems and such.
