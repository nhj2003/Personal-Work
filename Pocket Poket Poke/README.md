There's some stuff I wanted to add but might add later when I have the time or more expertise. (or when I care to do it)
1. Another tab that compares the max stats across each generation. Would be interesting to see how that changes with power creep
2. Another tab that simply looks at stats within a single generation. Maybe a graph comparing types against another?
3. I wanted to make it look a lot better and cleaner. Pokeballs as the radiobutton input, rainbow line for all types, things along those lines. I already tried implementing those but it took so long that I gave up

Otherwise this was a fun project to work on on a subject I really quite like. Surprisingly the power creep wasn't as bad as I thought it  would be. The stats 
didn't really reveal how badly powercreep has gotten in modern pokemon. It truly does feel that most of the powercreep has come in the form of new moves
or new abilities. It might be interesting to do another data visualization project on the power of moves, or perhaps do one on recent tournament wins and
the collective base power of moves within the tournament. Perhaps something along those lines.
