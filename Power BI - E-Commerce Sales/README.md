I genuinely do not enjoy working with Power BI. I made some visualizations on a single year, making some quarterly reports. Given the variables I had, 
I figured it would be nice to look at what product price range made the company the most money. Other than that I did not make the graphs look pretty because
I simply did not want to wrangle with the program any longer.
