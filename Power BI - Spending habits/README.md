Overall in the visualization, it doesn't seem to be that there are that many differences between ages or occupation with spending and income. 
This could be due to multiple reasons. The dataset could've been to small, it could've not been a good representation of the true population,
or maybe there just isn't that much of a difference anyways in the grand average scheme of things. Whatever the case, I hope the lack of difference
between the various categorical groups is evident in the visualizations I put in the power BI.
